# CrawfordShinyApps
BayesianMemroyApp is a simple shiny app that allows the user to see the prior, trace, and posterior distributions for an individual stimulus given different values of stimulus value, trace SD (i.e., noise in memory for the stimulus), prior mu (mean of the prior), prior sd (sd of the prior).
